Virtual People Factory (VPF) is my research group's web-based interface for creating and interacting with various virtual human (VH) experiences. An important component of VPF is the chat interaction page. Through iterative design, I worked with members of my research group to add features which would improve the overall virtual patient interviewing experience. Leveraging real-world concepts of the interviewing process, features like "Interview Progress" provide guidance on making meaningful progress through the interviewing experience.

This chat interface has been used by hundreds of medical students across the United States.
