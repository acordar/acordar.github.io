For this project, we created a mixed reality expereince in which MRHs were used to influence conflict resolution behavior amongst surgical technicians. We created a compelling experience in which surgical technicians witnessed a MRH surgeon argue with a MRH nurse over a patient safety issue. We found participants were more likely to speak up to a MRH surgeon after observing a MRH nurse sucessfully speak up to a MRH surgeon.
